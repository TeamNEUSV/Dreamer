Object:Design an instant messenger for students, faculty and staffs from or related to Northeastern University.
Why do we do it: to facilitate inter-personal communication between students
What do we have now?
Wechat: Chinese-based, faculty and staff don't have wechat, not easy to search and manage conversation, non-school peopel, etc. 
Slack: seems to be perfect, but hard to enforce everyone to join.

Step 1: Scope the Problem
- The system support group chat, direct message, broadcast
- The new user is by invitation or self-registration. Both will need approvement. Account username will be neu email, and everyone will have a basic profile with real name, major, year of enrollment, etc.  
- The group chat is conversation-based, someone start a thread and others reply to it. 
- The broadcast is visible to everyone on a separate panel. All emails from administrative staffs will be automatically forward to the broadcast panel. 
- We can set up notification within the app and via emails, on regular basis or on certain conditions.
- All files (pic, doc, etc) shared in the group chat or broadcast can be found in a separate section and easily to search by date or name. 

Step 2: Make Reasonable Assumptions
- Adding or deleting users is relatively unusual
- There will be peak and low time in terms of the traffic
-
